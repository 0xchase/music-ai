# Plan

## Short-term Tasks
 - High level design plan (Chase will work on this)
 - Be able to run [Onset and Frames](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/onsets-frames)
 - LSTM to generate midi files
 - Markov Model to generate midi files
 - TidalCycles
 - Machine learning for processing raw audio. GANs.

For now use the [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) library for reading/writing midi filese. Eventually we'll develop our own classees for this. Ideally we'd use pytorch for most ML related tasks, but tensorflow/keras will work also. 

## Long-term Goals
 - Various generative music techniques
 - Interactive music
 -
