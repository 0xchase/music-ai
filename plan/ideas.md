# Plan

Insert high-level design graphic here.

## Ideas
### Approaches
 - Generate using musical psychology models
 - Declarative language for music generation. (or a lisp???)

### Applications
 - Write ambient piano music
 - YouTube Eurorack generative
 - Eurorack modules that generates music
 - Interface with game sound software like fmod or wwise
 - Generate music based on EEG data for meditation
 - Remove noise from audio files
 - Mix and match various algorithms
 - Predict piano right hand using left hand data, or vice versa

## Resources
 - Computers in Iribe with GPUs

## Release
 - Present at same conference as music21, maybe some others also
 - Get professor advisor for continued development
 - Write medium articles for each technique to advertize
 - Email a bunch of machine learning teachers with link to framework, asking them to teach it
 - Set up eurorack demo
 - Create demos to promote on reddit
 - Get BenandGear to update computers making music, say maybe he didn't do justice to the techniques, but I wrote this framework to help
 - Build an album to demonstrate it's capabilities
 - Eurorack module that write melodies based on chord input
 - Talk about AI daw based on tracktion with AudioProgrammer

## Other tools
 - Lyrics generator with GPT-3
 - Profound poem generator with GPT-3
 - Album cover art generator
   - Start with abstract shapes (person could draw these), then stylize
   - Start with GAN face, then stylize
   - Start with cool text, then stylize
   - Start with Blender or physics simulatino, then stylize
